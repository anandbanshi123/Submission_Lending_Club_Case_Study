# Submission_Lending_Club_Case_Study
### Problem Statement - I

Introduction: This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.


If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.



The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,

## General Information
The data given contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:
Approved: The Company has approved loan Application

Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.

Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).

Unused offer: Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

Business Objectives: This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
